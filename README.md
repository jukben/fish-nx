# fish-nx

This package contains [Nx (Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos)](https://nx.dev) completions for [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell.

## Install

> I recommend to use [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to install this package

> This package uses [Jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) so make sure you have it installed. Brew will do on OSX.

```
fisher install jukben/fish-nx
```

## Usage

Make sure you have `nx` installed globally. Then you should be able to leverage the autocomplete (tab).
